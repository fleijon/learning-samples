= Parser combinators

== Introduction

Parsing, in this context, will be defined as the process of analyzing plain text of known logical structure and map it to a hierchical data model.

For example, a representation of a patient in the json format may look like this in plain text:

[source]
----
{
	"name": "John Doe",
	"dateOfBirth": "1980-01-01"
}
----

Which, when parsed, may be represented by a patient object here defined in C#

[source, csharp]
----
public class Patient
{
    public string Name { get; }
    public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; }
}
----
